## General Information
- Lending Club is a marketplace for personal loans that matches borrowers who are seeking a loan with investors looking to lend money and make a return.
- When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
<br>• If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
<br>• If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
- Identify risky applications as lending loans to the risky applicants leads to credit/financial loss. Identify driving factors leading to default of loan
